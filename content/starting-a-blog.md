Hello, world! I'm Luke, an undergraduate studying mathematics and computer science. In this first post, I just want to briefly introduce myself and explain why I decided to start writing a blog.

I am a rising junior at Harvard from New York City. I attended Hunter College High School, where I was fortunate to have a number of teachers who inspired me to study math and cs. In college, I have become interested in the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and statistics, particularly machine learning. At the moment, I am working on research projects applying deep learning to solve problems in computer vision and natural language processing.

I have decided to start writing a blog for a number of reasons. Most importantly, as someone beginning in research in deep learning, I have found others' technical blog posts to be a wonderful resource for building my understanding of the key ideas of field. Some technical blogs I have found particularly insightful have been [Chris Olah's blog](http://colah.github.io), [Jeremy Kun's blog](https://jeremykun.com/), [Harvard NLP's blog](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html), and [Distill](https://distill.pub/) (although Distill may be closer to a publication than a blog). With my own technical blog posts, I hope to be able to contribute to this community and help get more people excited about deep learning research. I have also noticed that I get much more out of technical blogs that include code, so I hope to incorporate code in all my technical posts. That being said, I may occasionally publish non-technical posts, either about math or something entirely different.

In my first few blog posts, I hope to discuss image colorization (turning a grayscale image into a colored image) and language modeling (predicting the next word in an incomplete sentence). 

I hope you enjoy the blog!  

Luke
