Summary: Hello, world! 

Hello, world!

I'm Luke, a student interested in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. 

I have decided to start writing posts here for a few reasons. For one, I personally enjoy reading a number of machine learning blogs, and I hope some people will find my writing enjoyable. Some sites I find particularly interesting include [Chris Olah's blog](http://colah.github.io), [Jeremy Kun's blog](https://jeremykun.com/), [Harvard NLP's blog](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html), and [Distill](https://distill.pub/) (although Distill may be closer to a publication than a blog). I find code helpful for understanding new ideas/models, so I'll try to incorporate code in my writing whenever possible.  Second, I feel this blog could be a good way for me to get experience with technical, non-academic writing. I've been trained to write English essays and history papers, but I've never written these sorts of posts before. 

In my first few posts, I hope to discuss [image colorization](/image-colorization.html) and [machinie translation](/machine-translation.html).

I hope you enjoy them!

Luke
