Summary: About

I'm a PhD student studying machine learning at Oxford University, broadly interested in machine learning and computer vision. I am lucky to be advised by [Professor Andrea Vedaldi]() in the [VGG Group](). 

My research is concentrated in semi-supervised learning, multi-modal learning, and self-supervised representation learning. 

I've also recently started an [undergraduate machine learning group] for undergrads interested in exploring the field. If that sounds interesting to you, please visit our website and join our Slack. 

I'm always interested in meeting new people and hearing about potential collaborations. If you'd like to work together or get in contact with me, please use [EMAIL] .
